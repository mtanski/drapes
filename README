Thanks for using Desktop Drapes; hope you enjoy it.

If you encounter any problems feel free to submit them to our bug tracker
located at https://launchpad.net/products/drapes/+filebug. Launchpad also has a nice infrastructure in place for making translations very easy, so if you would like to translate Drapes into your native language then we would appreciate it!

If you would like to contribute, an icon, documentation, code, man page, an
VAX port & translations feel free to contact me at mtanski@gmail.com.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Monitoring directories works (well) when mono and corresponding libraries are
  at least at version 1.2+.
* Using it as a panel applet causes issues, this is due to the applet bindings
  and bonobo being evil! The recommended way of running drapes is a tray icon.
  Sorry!

P.S: I was joking about the VAX port.
