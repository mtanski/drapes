Hai!

Thanks for using desktop drapes; hope you enjoy it.

The website is located at http://drapes.mindtouchsoftware.com. You can always 
get the latest version from there.

If you encounter any problems feel free to submit them to our bug tracker
located at https://launchpad.net/products/drapes/+filebug. From the launchpad
website for drapes you also should be able to translate the application to your
language, which I would apperciate greatly.

If you would like to contribute, an icon, documentation, code, man page, an
VAX port & translations feel free to write me at mtanski@gmail.com.

Bai!

P.S: I was joking about the VAX port.
