Description: a desktop wallpaper managment application for the GNOME desktop
 the aim of drapes is to compliment (replace) the built in GNOME desktop
 wallpaper selection tool. It can be configured as a tray application or as a
 panel applet. The bigest selling point of drapes is ability to rotate wallapers
 on a timely basis. It strives to be as simple as possible and fit in the rest
 of the GNOME 2 desktop.
